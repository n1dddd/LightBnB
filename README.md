# LightBnb

LightBnb is a project resembling Airbnb

This repository includes a basic front end and back end, that allows users to login/signup, look at previous reservations ranked by rating, send data to the server for owners who want to list their property. The focus of this project was SQL queries, followed by integrating JavaScript and SQL together, simultaneously.

Random seed data was used to populate where normal information/data would go.

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.
